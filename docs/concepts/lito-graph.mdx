# Lito Graph

The LitoGraph is the top-level data structure output by the compiler. It contains all nodes, edges, and computed statistics from a documentation directory.

## Overview

A LitoGraph is serialized as `graph.json` and can be loaded by the MCP server or inspected via the CLI.

## Schema

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "generated_at": "2026-02-27T15:55:05.738Z",
  "source_dir": "/path/to/docs",
  "stats": {
    "total_nodes": 12,
    "total_edges": 15,
    "nodes_by_type": { "doc": 2, "concept": 2, "api": 3, "workflow": 1, "step": 4 },
    "edges_by_type": { "ACTS_ON": 4, "RELATED_TO": 3, "USES_API": 1 },
    "unresolved_refs": 1
  },
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": []
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | `string` | Graph schema version |
| `generated_at` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the graph was built |
| `source_dir` | `string` | Absolute path to the source documentation directory |
| `stats` | `GraphStats` | Computed statistics |
| `nodes` | `GraphNode[]` | All nodes in the graph |
| `edges` | `Edge[]` | All edges connecting nodes |

## Properties

- **Deterministic** — building the same docs always produces the same graph (node IDs are hashed from `source_path:type`)
- **Self-contained** — `graph.json` includes everything needed to serve the MCP tools
- **Incrementally useful** — unresolved references produce warnings, not errors

## Relationships

- Contains all **GraphNodes** in the documentation
- Contains all **GraphEdges** connecting those nodes
