# Graph Node

A node is the fundamental unit of the Lito Graph. Every Markdown file produces at least one node. Workflow files also produce StepNode children.

## Overview

All nodes share a common set of base fields and extend them with type-specific data.

## Node Types

| Type | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `doc` | Any `.md`/`.mdx` without a `type` field | Standard documentation page |
| `concept` | `type: concept` | Domain entity (Workspace, User, Project) |
| `api` | `type: api` or legacy `api: "GET /path"` | Callable capability (HTTP endpoint, function) |
| `workflow` | `type: workflow` | Multi-step procedure with guardrails |
| `step` | Auto-generated from workflow `## Steps` | Individual action within a workflow |

## Base Fields

Every node has these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Deterministic SHA-256 hash of `source_path:type` |
| `type` | `string` | One of: `doc`, `concept`, `api`, `workflow`, `step` |
| `title` | `string` | From frontmatter `title` or derived from slug |
| `summary` | `string` | From `description` or first paragraph of body |
| `source_path` | `string` | Relative path to the source file |
| `slug` | `string` | URL-friendly path (e.g., `/concepts/workspace`) |
| `anchors` | `string[]` | Heading IDs extracted from the document |
| `version` | `string?` | Version tag (e.g., `"v1"`) |
| `locale` | `string?` | Language locale (e.g., `"es"`) |
| `tags` | `string[]` | Freeform tags for filtering |

## Relationships

- Each GraphNode belongs to exactly one **LitoGraph**
- GraphNodes connect to each other via **GraphEdges**
- WorkflowNodes contain child **StepNodes** via `CONTAINS` edges
