# Graph Edge

An edge is a typed, directed connection between two graph nodes. Edges are the key differentiator between Lito Graph and flat document search — they encode relationships agents can traverse.

## Overview

Edges are resolved automatically from frontmatter fields during the build pipeline. When a reference can't be resolved, it creates an `unresolved:` edge with a warning instead of failing the build.

## Edge Categories

### Structural Edges

Derived from file system hierarchy:

| Type | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `PARENT_OF` | Directory index → child pages | Folder structure |
| `CHILD_OF` | Child page → directory index | Folder structure |
| `NEXT_SECTION` | Sequential navigation | Sidebar order |

### Semantic Edges

Derived from concept relationships:

| Type | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `RELATED_TO` | Bidirectional concept link | `related_entities` field |
| `DEPENDS_ON` | Hard dependency | Explicit annotation |
| `CONTAINS` | Parent-child containment | Workflow → StepNodes |
| `DEPRECATED_BY` | Superseded by newer version | Explicit annotation |

### Capability Edges

Derived from API metadata:

| Type | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `ACTS_ON` | API operates on an entity | `resource` field |
| `REQUIRES` | Prerequisite for operation | `preconditions` field |
| `EMITS` | Produces events/effects | `side_effects` field |
| `USES_API` | Step calls an API | Backtick refs in workflow steps |

### Procedural Edges

Derived from workflow structure:

| Type | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `NEXT_STEP_OF` | Sequential step chain | Step ordering |
| `ON_FAILURE_TRIGGER` | Error recovery workflow | Recovery section |
| `ESCALATES_TO` | Human escalation path | Recovery section |

## Edge Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source` | `string` | Source node ID |
| `target` | `string` | Target node ID (or `unresolved:Name` for broken refs) |
| `type` | `EdgeType` | One of the 14 edge types above |
| `label` | `string?` | Human-readable label for the relationship |
