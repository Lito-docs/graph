# IDE Setup

Lito Graph serves its data via MCP (Model Context Protocol) over stdio. This works with any MCP-compatible client. No cloning required — `npx` handles everything.

## Claude Code

Create `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@litodocs/graph", "https://docs.example.com/graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start a new Claude Code session. Run `/mcp` to verify the server is connected.

## Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@litodocs/graph", "https://docs.example.com/graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@litodocs/graph", "https://docs.example.com/graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Local Development

For local development, you can also use the CLI directly with Bun:

```bash
# Build + serve in one step
lito-graph serve -i ./path/to/docs

# Or serve a pre-built graph file
lito-graph serve -g ./graph.json
```

## Verify Connection

Once connected, ask your agent:

> "Using lito-graph tools, show me the graph stats."

You should see node and edge counts from your documentation.
