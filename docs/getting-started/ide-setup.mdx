# IDE Setup

Lito Graph serves its data via MCP (Model Context Protocol) over stdio. This works with any MCP-compatible client.

## Claude Code

Create `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "path/to/lito-graph/bin/cli.ts", "serve", "-g", "./graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start a new Claude Code session. Run `/mcp` to verify the server is connected.

## Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "path/to/lito-graph/bin/cli.ts", "serve", "-g", "./graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "path/to/lito-graph/bin/cli.ts", "serve", "-g", "./graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Build + Serve

You can skip pre-building `graph.json` and point directly at your docs folder:

```bash
# Builds graph on startup, then serves via MCP
bun run bin/cli.ts serve -i ./path/to/docs
```

## Verify Connection

Once connected, ask your agent:

> "Using lito-graph tools, show me the graph stats."

You should see node and edge counts from your documentation.
