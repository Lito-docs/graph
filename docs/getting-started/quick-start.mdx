# Quick Start

Build a graph from your docs and start querying it in under 2 minutes.

## Option A: Use a hosted graph (zero-install)

If your docs site already serves `graph.json`, connect any MCP client with one command — no cloning, no dependencies:

```bash
npx -y @litodocs/graph https://docs.example.com/graph.json
```

Skip to [step 5](#5-connect-to-claude-code) to wire it into your IDE.

## Option B: Build locally

### 1. Install

```bash
cd lito-graph
bun install
```

### 2. Build a Graph

Point it at any folder of Markdown files:

```bash
lito-graph build -i ./path/to/docs -o ./graph.json
```

You'll see output like:

```
◇  Found 12 nodes, 15 edges
◇  Graph written to graph.json

  Node breakdown:
    api: 3
    concept: 2
    doc: 2
    workflow: 1
    step: 4
```

### 3. Inspect the Graph

```bash
# Overview stats
lito-graph inspect -g ./graph.json --stats

# List all nodes
lito-graph inspect -g ./graph.json --nodes

# Filter by type
lito-graph inspect -g ./graph.json --type api

# Find broken references
lito-graph inspect -g ./graph.json --unresolved
```

### 4. Start the MCP Server

```bash
lito-graph serve -g ./graph.json
```

Or build and serve in one step:

```bash
lito-graph serve -i ./path/to/docs
```

## 5. Connect to Claude Code

Create `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@litodocs/graph", "https://docs.example.com/graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start a new Claude Code session. You'll have access to all 7 graph tools.

## Next Steps

- [Writing Graph Docs](/getting-started/writing-graph-docs) — add `type: concept`, `type: api`, and `type: workflow` to your frontmatter
- [MCP Tools](/api/list-nodes) — explore the tools agents can use
