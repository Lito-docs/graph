# Quick Start

Build a graph from your docs and start querying it in under 2 minutes.

## 1. Install

```bash
cd lito-graph
bun install
```

## 2. Build a Graph

Point it at any folder of Markdown files:

```bash
bun run bin/cli.ts build -i ./path/to/docs -o ./graph.json
```

You'll see output like:

```
◇  Found 12 nodes, 15 edges
◇  Graph written to graph.json

  Node breakdown:
    api: 3
    concept: 2
    doc: 2
    workflow: 1
    step: 4
```

## 3. Inspect the Graph

```bash
# Overview stats
bun run bin/cli.ts inspect -g ./graph.json --stats

# List all nodes
bun run bin/cli.ts inspect -g ./graph.json --nodes

# Filter by type
bun run bin/cli.ts inspect -g ./graph.json --type api

# Find broken references
bun run bin/cli.ts inspect -g ./graph.json --unresolved
```

## 4. Start the MCP Server

```bash
bun run bin/cli.ts serve -g ./graph.json
```

Or build and serve in one step:

```bash
bun run bin/cli.ts serve -i ./path/to/docs
```

## 5. Connect to Claude Code

Create `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lito-graph": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "path/to/lito-graph/bin/cli.ts", "serve", "-g", "./graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start a new Claude Code session. You'll have access to all 7 graph tools.

## Next Steps

- [Writing Graph Docs](/getting-started/writing-graph-docs) — add `type: concept`, `type: api`, and `type: workflow` to your frontmatter
- [MCP Tools](/api/list-nodes) — explore the tools agents can use
