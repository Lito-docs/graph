# Writing Graph Docs

Lito Graph recognizes four document types based on the `type` field in frontmatter. Standard docs work with no changes — you only add annotations when you want richer graph structure.

## Standard Docs (default)

Any Markdown file without a `type` field becomes a `DocNode`:

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
description: "How to get started."
tags: ["guide"]
section: "Guides"
---
```

No changes needed to existing docs.

## Concept Docs

Describe domain entities that agents should understand:

```yaml
---
type: concept
canonical_name: "Workspace"
entity_type: "resource"
aliases: ["Org Workspace", "Team Workspace"]
related_entities:
  - "User"
  - "Project"
tags: ["core"]
version: "v1"
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | Yes | Must be `"concept"` |
| `canonical_name` | Yes | The primary name for this entity |
| `entity_type` | No | Category: `"resource"`, `"event"`, `"config"` |
| `aliases` | No | Alternative names agents should recognize |
| `related_entities` | No | Creates `RELATED_TO` edges to other concepts |

### Recommended Sections

- **Overview** — what this entity is
- **Fields / Properties** — its data shape
- **Relationships** — how it connects to other entities
- **Common Operations** — what typically happens to it

## API Docs

Describe callable capabilities:

```yaml
---
type: api
operation_id: "create_workspace"
api_type: "http"
method: "POST"
path: "/v1/workspaces"
resource: "Workspace"
capabilities:
  - "create"
  - "provision"
side_effects:
  - "creates_workspace_record"
  - "sends_welcome_email"
preconditions:
  - "user_authenticated"
  - "billing_plan_active"
permissions:
  - "workspace:write"
rate_limit: "50 requests / minute"
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | Yes | Must be `"api"` |
| `operation_id` | Yes | Unique identifier for this operation |
| `method` | No | HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| `path` | No | Endpoint path |
| `resource` | No | Creates `ACTS_ON` edge to matching concept |
| `capabilities` | No | What this API can do |
| `preconditions` | No | What must be true before calling |
| `permissions` | No | Required permissions |
| `side_effects` | No | What changes after calling |

### Backward Compatibility

Existing Lito API frontmatter is auto-converted:

```yaml
# Old format — still works
api: "GET /users"
```

This becomes `method: "GET"`, `path: "/users"`, `operation_id: "get_users"`.

## Workflow Docs

Define multi-step procedures agents can follow:

```yaml
---
type: workflow
workflow_id: "onboard_new_workspace"
goal: "Onboard a new customer workspace with default settings."
primary_entity: "Workspace"
risk_level: "medium"
requires_human_approval: true
tags: ["onboarding"]
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | Yes | Must be `"workflow"` |
| `workflow_id` | Yes | Unique identifier |
| `goal` | Yes | What this workflow achieves |
| `primary_entity` | No | Creates `ACTS_ON` edge to matching concept |
| `risk_level` | No | `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"` |
| `requires_human_approval` | No | If true, agent must pause and ask |

### Required Body Sections

The compiler parses these `## Heading` sections:

```markdown
## Preconditions
- User has valid billing plan.
- Customer account exists.

## Steps
1. Create workspace via `create_workspace` API.
2. Assign default roles.
3. Send onboarding email.

## Failure Modes
- Workspace creation fails due to invalid billing.

## Recovery
- If billing invalid: trigger `notify_billing_issue`.

## Guardrails
- Never delete existing workspaces during onboarding.
- Escalate to human if creation fails twice.
```

Backtick-wrapped names in Steps (e.g., `` `create_workspace` ``) create `USES_API` edges to matching ApiNodes.
