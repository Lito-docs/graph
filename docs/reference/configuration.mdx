# Configuration

Lito Graph uses standard Lito `docs-config.json` for site configuration. The graph compiler reads documentation files independently of this config.

## Graph-Specific Settings

The graph compiler does not require `docs-config.json`. It works with any folder of Markdown files. However, when your docs also serve as a Lito site, the same `docs-config.json` controls both.

## File Exclusions

The compiler automatically excludes these directories:

| Directory | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `_assets/` | Static asset files |
| `_css/` | Custom stylesheets |
| `_images/` | Image files |
| `_static/` | Static files |
| `_landing/` | Custom landing page HTML |
| `_navbar/` | Custom navbar HTML |
| `_footer/` | Custom footer HTML |
| `public/` | Public static files |
| `node_modules/` | Dependencies |

And these files:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `docs-config.json` | Site configuration, not content |
| `vercel.json` | Deployment config |
| `netlify.toml` | Deployment config |
| `README.md` | Repository readme, not documentation |

## MCP Server Configuration

The MCP server is configured in your IDE's MCP settings, not in `docs-config.json`. See [IDE Setup](/getting-started/ide-setup) for details.

## Build Output

The `graph.json` output path defaults to `./graph.json` in the current directory. Override with `-o`:

```bash
lito-graph build -i ./docs -o ./dist/graph.json
```

The output is a self-contained JSON file that can be versioned, deployed, or loaded by the MCP server.
