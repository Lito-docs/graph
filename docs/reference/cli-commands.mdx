# CLI Commands

## build

Compile a documentation directory into `graph.json`.

```bash
lito-graph build -i ./docs -o ./graph.json
```

### Options

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `-i, --input <path>` | Yes | — | Path to the docs folder |
| `-o, --output <path>` | No | `./graph.json` | Output file path |

### Output

Prints a summary with node counts by type, edge counts by type, and any unresolved reference warnings.

## serve

Start an MCP server exposing the graph via stdio transport.

```bash
# From pre-built graph
lito-graph serve -g ./graph.json

# Build and serve in one step
lito-graph serve -i ./docs
```

### Options

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `-g, --graph <path>` | No | — | Path to pre-built graph.json |
| `-i, --input <path>` | No | — | Path to docs folder (builds graph on startup) |

One of `--graph` or `--input` is required.

### Behavior

- All logging goes to stderr (stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC)
- The server exposes 7 tools and 2 resources
- Stays running until the parent process terminates

## inspect

Query and inspect a built graph from the command line.

```bash
lito-graph inspect -g ./graph.json --stats
```

### Options

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `-g, --graph <path>` | Yes | — | Path to graph.json |
| `--stats` | No | Default | Show graph statistics |
| `--nodes` | No | — | List all nodes |
| `--type <type>` | No | — | Filter nodes by type |
| `--node <id>` | No | — | Show details for a specific node |
| `--edges` | No | — | List all edges |
| `--orphans` | No | — | Show nodes with no edges |
| `--unresolved` | No | — | Show unresolved references |

Multiple flags can be combined. If no flag is provided, `--stats` is the default.
