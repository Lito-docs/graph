# Agent Discovery

This workflow describes the recommended pattern for AI agents to use the Lito Graph MCP tools.

## Preconditions

- Lito Graph MCP server is running and connected to the agent's IDE.
- A graph has been built from the project's documentation.

## Steps

1. Call `get_graph_stats` to understand the scope of the documentation.
2. Call `list_nodes` with type filters to discover available concepts, APIs, and workflows.
3. Call `search` with the user's intent to find relevant nodes.
4. Call `get_node` to read full details of matching nodes.
5. Call `traverse` to explore connected nodes and understand relationships.
6. Call `get_workflow` if a multi-step procedure is needed.
7. Call `find_apis_for_entity` to discover all capabilities for a given entity.

## Failure Modes

- Search returns no results because docs lack graph frontmatter annotations.
- Workflow steps reference APIs that don't have corresponding API docs.

## Recovery

- If search returns empty: fall back to listing all nodes and filtering manually.
- If unresolved API references exist: warn the user that documentation is incomplete.

## Guardrails

- Always check `requires_human_approval` on workflows before executing steps.
- Always check `risk_level` and present it to the user for medium or high risk workflows.
- Never execute API calls without first reading their preconditions and permissions.
- Present guardrails from workflow docs to the user before proceeding.
