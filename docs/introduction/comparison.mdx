# Lito Graph vs Context7

Lito Graph and [Context7](https://context7.com) solve **different problems**. They're complementary — use both.

## The Core Difference

**Context7** is a **live docs lookup** for third-party libraries. Ask "how do I use React hooks?" and it fetches the latest React docs. It prevents hallucination by giving agents real API signatures.

**Lito Graph** compiles **your own docs** into a typed knowledge graph that agents can traverse, plan with, and act on safely. It's not a search tool — it's a reasoning layer.

```
Your agent's toolbox:
├── Context7 MCP      → "How do I use this library?"  (external knowledge)
└── Lito Graph MCP    → "How does our system work?"   (internal knowledge)
    ├── What entities exist?
    ├── What APIs act on them?
    ├── What workflows should I follow?
    └── What guardrails must I respect?
```

## Feature Comparison

|  | Context7 | Lito Graph |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Look up third-party library docs | Operate on your own product/domain |
| **Data format** | Flat text chunks (RAG-style) | Typed nodes + 14 edge types (graph) |
| **Relationships** | None — isolated text results | `ACTS_ON`, `USES_API`, `RELATED_TO`, etc. |
| **Planning** | Returns one page at a time | Full workflows with ordered steps + linked API details |
| **Safety** | Hopes the agent reads warnings | `requires_human_approval`, `risk_level`, `guardrails` as machine-readable fields |
| **Completeness** | Top-k search results (might miss things) | Graph traversal (guaranteed exhaustive) |
| **Setup** | Zero — works instantly | Requires build step + optional frontmatter annotations |
| **Freshness** | Always live, no build step | Requires rebuild when docs change |
| **Privacy** | Cloud service (queries go to their servers) | Fully local, self-hosted, private |
| **Breadth** | Thousands of libraries out of the box | Only your own docs |

## Where Each Wins

### Context7 is better for:

- **Third-party libraries** — "How does Express.js routing work?"
- **Quick lookups** — zero setup, instant results
- **Staying current** — always fetches the latest published docs
- **Breadth** — covers thousands of popular libraries

### Lito Graph is better for:

- **Your own domain** — "What entities exist in our platform?"
- **Relationships** — "What APIs act on the Workspace entity?"
- **Multi-step planning** — "Walk me through the full onboarding workflow"
- **Safety enforcement** — "Does this workflow need human approval?"
- **Impact analysis** — "If I change Workspace, what breaks?"
- **Completeness** — "Show me everything connected to this entity"
- **Privacy** — internal docs never leave your machine

## Concrete Example

### With Context7

```
Agent: "How do I create a workspace?"
Context7: Returns a docs page about workspace creation
Agent: Reads it, tries to call the API
→ Might miss the preconditions
→ Might not know about the onboarding workflow
→ Doesn't know it needs human approval
```

### With Lito Graph

```
Agent: "How do I create a workspace?"
→ search("workspace") finds ConceptNode(Workspace)
→ find_apis_for_entity("Workspace") returns 3 APIs with full metadata
→ get_workflow("onboard_new_workspace") returns:
  - 4 ordered steps with linked API details
  - preconditions: user_authenticated, billing_plan_active
  - guardrails: "Never delete existing workspaces"
  - requires_human_approval: true
→ Agent asks for approval before proceeding
→ Executes steps in order, checking preconditions
→ If step fails, follows recovery path
```

## The Bottom Line

Context7 prevents hallucinating API signatures.
Lito Graph prevents **unsafe actions on your own systems**.

Different problems. Complementary solutions. Use both.

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Best tool |
|----------|-----------|
| "How do I use Express.js middleware?" | Context7 |
| "What's the full onboarding flow for our platform?" | Lito Graph |
| "What's the React useState API?" | Context7 |
| "Which of our APIs require admin permissions?" | Lito Graph |
| "How do I configure Tailwind?" | Context7 |
| "What happens if workspace creation fails?" | Lito Graph |
| "What's new in Next.js 15?" | Context7 |
| "What entities does the delete API affect?" | Lito Graph |
