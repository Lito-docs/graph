# What is Lito Graph?

Lito Graph transforms your Markdown documentation into a **typed knowledge & workflow graph** that AI agents can reason over, plan with, and act on — not just search through.

## The Problem

Today, agents consume docs via RAG: chunk text, embed it, retrieve the top-k similar chunks. This has fundamental limitations:

- **No relationships** — RAG finds the "Create User" page but doesn't know it *acts on* the User entity or is *step 2* of an onboarding workflow
- **No planning** — an agent can't answer "what's the full sequence to onboard a customer?" because steps are scattered across pages
- **No safety** — nothing tells the agent "this workflow requires human approval" or "never delete workspaces during onboarding"

## The Solution

Lito Graph adds a compilation layer between your docs and agents:

```
Markdown + Frontmatter  →  Lito Graph Compiler  →  graph.json  →  MCP Server  →  AI Agents
```

Your docs stay human-readable. Light annotations in frontmatter create machine-traversable structure.

## Key Features

- **5 node types** — DocNode, ConceptNode, ApiNode, WorkflowNode, StepNode
- **14 edge types** — structural, semantic, capability, and procedural relationships
- **7 MCP tools** — list, get, traverse, search, workflow, entity APIs, stats
- **Backward compatible** — existing Lito `api: "GET /users"` format auto-converts
- **Deterministic** — same docs always produce the same graph
